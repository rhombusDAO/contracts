ALWAYS USE UNSIGNED INT WHEN DOING BINARY OPERATIONS

a^^b = xor  // looks for different values

shifting to the left <<
is the same as multiplying by 2

shifting to the right >> 
is dividing by 2

& - used for reading values from a number

| - used for writing values to a number

a  = 1001
b = 0101

a = a^b
b = a^b
a = a^b
 - these operations swap a and b without creating a temp value

  a & b === b
   - does 'a' contain 'b'?
